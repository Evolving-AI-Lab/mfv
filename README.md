## Installation
* Install Caffe and its Python interface
* Some Python libraries are required and can be installed quickly via e.g. Anaconda

## Usage
* Starting optimization from mean images. Here I provided 10 mean images for two example classes: "bell pepper" and "movie theater".
```bash
    ./opt_from_mean.sh 945  # bell pepper
    ./opt_from_mean.sh 498  # movie theater
```

* Optimizing images with "center-bias regularization" (CBR)
```bash
   ./opt_center_bias.sh 945  
```

## Notes
* Examples are not provided, but with the code, you could also try other experiments like:
 * Running CBR from a mean image (Fig. S8 in the paper)
 * Starting from a real image (Fig. S1 in the paper)

* In the paper, we show different ways to compute the mean image (e.g. from training or val set). The code for this is not provided here, but is straightforward to implement (see paper for more).
